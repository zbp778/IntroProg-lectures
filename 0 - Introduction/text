The parameter $\alpha$ is set equal to 0.5, which is equivalent to assuming that the male and female member of the household is equally productive working at home. To be able to match the data we incorporate a disutillity parameter $\mu$ in the model. The new utility function for the household thus becomes:

$\frac{Q^{1-p}}{1-p}-\nu(\frac{T_M^{1+\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{1+\frac{1}{\epsilon}}+\frac{T_F^{1+\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{1+\frac{1}{\epsilon}})-\mu\max(\frac{w_M}{w_F},1)H_M$

The new utility function of the household is decreasing in the number of hours the male member of the household works at home. The disutility increases in the relative wage for men $\frac{w_M}{w_F}$ for $w_M>w_F$, and is constant for $w_M \le w_F$. The disutility is scaled with the parameter $\mu$.

The interpretation of the extension is that traditional cultural gender norms could lead men to have a higher disutility of doing work at home. Futhermore, this norm could be stronger in couples where the male wage is higher than the female wage.

We update the code that is used in Question 4, such that we now minimize the squared deviation from the target beta parameters wrt. $\mu$ and $\sigma$, holding $\alpha$ fixed at $0.5$.

As seen below this matches the data for $\mu=0.377$, $\sigma=0.106$ and $\alpha=0.5$.
